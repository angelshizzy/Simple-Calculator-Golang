# Simple-Calculator-Golang
This project is part of my Moringa School capstone, I used Generative AI prompts to explore and learn a new software development technology and document the learning process in a way that others can easily follow. For this project, I chose to learn Golang (Go) to build a simple command-line calculator as a runnable beginner project.
